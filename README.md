# Simple-Linear-Regression

The regression model maps a line to the relationship between independent and dependent variables. When only one set of independent variables are correlated to dependent variables, the model is simple. When this relationship between them is linear, the regression model is Linear as well. So that's a Simple Linear Regression model.

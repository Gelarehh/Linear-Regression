# Simple-Linear-Regression

The regression model maps a line to the relationship between independent and dependent variables. When only one set of independent variables are correlated to dependent variables, the model is simple. When the relationship between them is linear, the regression model is Linear as well. So that's a **Simple Linear Regression** model. The diagram below shows a data distribution being adequately mapped to a simple linear regression model.

The dataset used for the training and test simulations is the average annual temperature between 1895 and 2019 for the Lower 48 states of the United States.
20% of the dataset is saved for testing, and the evaluation metric is the well-known mean square error (MSE).
